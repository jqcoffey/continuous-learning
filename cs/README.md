# Computer Science

My day job doesn't really let me code.  I'm a big M manager, which means I mostly sit in meetings and try to make sure things move forward with no one losing it (myself included).  What follows is an incomplete and somewhat aspirational list of resources that I've used/read and probably will need to reuse/reread by the time I get through all of them.

## Basic CS

Because you can never practice enough.

### C Programming

Coursera has a reasonably good course on the basics of programming in C.  It's a bit remedial, but since it's C it's nice and low-level and hey, practice makes perfect!

Also, read the book:

### Computer Science Theory

Another Coursera course by one of the best instructors around, Robert Sedgewick.  This is a bit slow and remedial as well, but DFAs, Turing Machines, etc. are well explained and it's well worth the startup cost.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

I guess some folks would consider this "basic CS," but given the number of professional programmers who don't know this stuff, I would disagree.

### Algorithms, Part I and Part II

There are a bunch of these courses around, but really, why wouldn't you want to learn core algorithms and data structures from the guy who invented red-black trees?

## Programming Languages

It's more than just loops and assignment!

### Programming Languages, Part A and B

A deep dive into the theory of programming languages via programming!

* https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages

### Crafting Interpreters

Write your own language, interpreter and compiler

## Computer Organization

Going beyond assembling a white-box PC.

### Code: The Hidden Language of Computer HW and SW

An excellent book that takes you from light bulbs and light switches to integrated circuits.

### From NAND to Tetris

Just an amazing course from two amazing professors.  If you really want to open up the black box of a computer, this is it.

* https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2 (not started)

### Computer Architecture

This is the grad-level course on microprocessor design.  It's definitely one to do after you've done things like NAND to Tetris, C Programming and written a compiler (see above, crafting interpeters).
